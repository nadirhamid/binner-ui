## App Layout
- **\__init__.py** - Root of your Flask application. For more on understanding this application structure,   
see the [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/packages/)
- **views.py** - Application view functions. For more on getting started building view functions,
 read the [Quickstart](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/) guide.
- **errors.py** - Application error functions for your basic [HTTP standard response errors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error)
- **README.md** - You're looking at it! :) 
- **static** - Store you Javascript, CSS, and image files here. 
Along with your 3rd party vendor static files, such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
For more info on using static files in Flask, see the [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#static-files).
- **templates** - HTML files go here. Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine.
 For more info on using Jinja2, see the [documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/)
